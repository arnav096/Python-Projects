### Aim: 
To perform EDA on mobile data of two websites using web-scraping technique.
### Objective:
Find out the feasible range for buying phone based on some features such as rating,discount etc.
### Dataset
The dataset is being generated with the help of web-scraping technique. The data contains 12 attributes as brand,model,color,ram,rom,battery,camera,ratings,star,reviews,price and offrate.
### EDA
* Most costliest model sold out.
* Most cheapest model sold out.
* Max discounted model.
* Highest model rating.
* Number of mobiles sold out by model.
* Trending phone color sold out.
* Profit of phones by model.(Total)
* Star vs Price.
* Ratings vs Segments.
* Battery vs Segments.
* ROM vs Segments.
* Reviews vs Segments.
